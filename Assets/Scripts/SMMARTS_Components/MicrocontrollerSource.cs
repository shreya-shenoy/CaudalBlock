	/// 
	/// Class Overview:
	/// The purpose of this script is to provide simple bi-directional communication between the physical microcontroller and the associated software trying
	/// to communicate with it. The Microcontroller class establishes a link between any available external microcontroller connected through USB to the
	/// machine operating this script. The connected microcontroller can either be found dynamically through an attempted connection to all open COM port, 
	/// or, if desired, to a predefined COM port. A handshake sequence assures the proper establishment of the connection to a CSSALT provided WhiteBox.
	/// New modifications enable simple transition between a normal operation mode, and a replay formatted mode. When in the replay mode, this script takes
	/// saved Microcontroller data it's given, converts it to usable data, and runs on that data as if it were operating in the exact same state as when
	/// that data was recorded. Even in replay mode, the connection (and if not connected, connection attempts) are maintained and run in the background on
	/// a separate thread.
	/// 
	/// Dependencies:
	/// This class runs as a standalone class and has no dependencies.
	/// 
	/// Developer:
	///	A version of the microcontroller existed since before 2016 with initial concept: Dave Lizdas
	///	Handshake implementation: Kaizad Avari circa 2017.
	///	Improved communication methodology, connection routine, and general overhaul courtesy of:
	///	Andre Kazimierz Bigos
	///	2018.08.07
	///	YYYY.MM.DD
